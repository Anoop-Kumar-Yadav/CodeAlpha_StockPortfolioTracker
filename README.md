## 🧠 Overview

This is a **desktop-based prototype application** that allows users to track their stock portfolio in real time. It was built as part of my **Python Programming Internship at CodeAlpha**.

The app provides a clean GUI where users can input stock symbols and quantities, fetch **live stock prices** via the `yfinance` API, and visualize their total investment using a **bar chart powered by `matplotlib`**.

---

## 🚀 Features

* ✅ GUI built with **PyQt6**
* ✅ Input multiple stock symbols and quantities
* ✅ Fetch **live prices** using `yfinance`
* ✅ Calculate and display **total investment**
* ✅ Render stock-wise value using **matplotlib bar chart**
* ✅ Save the full report to a **CSV file** for offline use
